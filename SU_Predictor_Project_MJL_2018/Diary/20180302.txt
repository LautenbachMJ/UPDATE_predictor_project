Today I fixed the problem of the sliding window, which was not adjustable. I hardcoded the padding with 1, which worked for window size 3 but not for bigger window sizes.
I still have a problem with the prediction and the reencoding.

An idea how to input a sequence for topology prediction:

import pickle

def predictor(model, sequence):
    filehandle = open(sequence,'r')
    loaded_model = pickle.load(open(model, 'rb'))
    
    lines = [line.strip() for line in filehandle]
    seq_test = lines[0:]
    print(seq_test)
    
    result = loaded_model.predict(seq_test)
    print(result)
    '''   
    results = list(result)
    for n, i in enumerate(results):
        if i == 0:
            results[n] = 'g'
        else:
            results[n] = 'B'
            
    return results
     '''
if __name__ == '__main__':
    #print(input_convertion('testdataset_aa_seq_one.txt'))
    print(predictor('model.sav', 'test_pred_seq.txt'))
