    done    Extract the feature from your dataset
    done    Create cross-validated sets
    done    Train a SVM using single sequence information, using sklearn
    done    Check different window sizes for the inputs
            Add evolutionary information by running psi-blast and extracting the information
            Train a SVM using multiple sequence information
    done    Optimize the performance of the SVM
            Analyze the results and compare it to previous work
    done    Use random forests and a simple decision tree and compare the performance with the SVM performance.
            Extract the data from 50 other proteins and test the performance
            Review the state of art for your predictor
